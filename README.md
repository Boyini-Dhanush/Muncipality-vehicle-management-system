# Muncipality-vehicle-management-system

## Overview
The **Municipal Vehicle Tracking System** is a comprehensive solution designed to monitor and manage municipal vehicle fleets, including public transit buses, waste collection trucks, snowplows, and utility vehicles. By leveraging real-time GPS tracking, route optimization, and data analytics, the system enhances operational efficiency, reduces costs, and improves transparency for municipal operations. It provides fleet managers with actionable insights through a user-friendly dashboard and supports optional public-facing features, such as real-time transit updates for citizens.

This project aims to streamline fleet management, ensure compliance with regulations, and optimize resource allocation for municipalities.
